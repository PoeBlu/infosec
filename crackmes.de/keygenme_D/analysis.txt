generation of the serial based on the username is performed at *0x4023b8
check for matching serials is performed at *0x40249f
interesting block preceding the two is at *0x4023a3

* [ebp+var_8] must be some form of counter loop variable 
* resulting generated key is always 9 digits long,
	* 10 if it has a - sign 
	* 8 if it is a numeric input

while ( counter_var <= strlen(name){
	<derive key here >
}

foreach byte of name :
	v1 = byte / 5 ;
	v2 = byte % 5 ;
	ecx = v1 ;
	sar ecx, 1Fh
	eax = 23e ; mov from mem
	edx = 0	  ; mov from mem 
	ecx *= eax
	edx *= ebx
	ecx += edx
	eax *= ebx
	edx += ecx
	[ebp-10h] = eax
	edi = byte
	edx = edi
	sar edx , 1fh
	[kebp - 10h] += edi
