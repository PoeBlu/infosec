look at disassembly of main
	mov ebx, offset __data_start__  < examine this
it's a string, but each char is a 4-byte integer :
.data:00402000 __data_start__
67h ; g

79h ; y

rep movsd is a sign that we are moving doubles; 8 doubles I think.

esp+5Ch+var_14 is the index in the supplied string!
esp+5Ch+var_34 is the local variable address of the password
esp+5Ch+var_3E is the address of where user input is stored

so each char of the password is XORed with 1 and then the result is compared with user input, if they match you go on !
