function 080484FB seems to just increment memory location dword_8049CA4 by 2

code in location 08048390 is called to take the input and call validation functions, as well as show success/fail

function 08048801 seems to return 1 or 0 based on password validity
    I believe we want the codepath at 0x80488ba

function 08048519 seems to be the transformation function
    seems to do linear transformations, i.e. f(a)=x, f(b)=x+1
    dependent on a per-letter basis
    it's ROT13 for a-z
        2 -> 0x18 24
        1 -> 0x5e 94
        0 -> 0x0  0

          while $eax < 16
          x/w $ebp+(4*$eax)-0x4c
          set $eax=$eax+1
          end
          
           0xffffce20:  -1
           0xffffce24:  17
           0xffffce28:  -11
           0xffffce2c:  3
           0xffffce30:  -8
           0xffffce34:  5
           0xffffce38:  14
           0xffffce3c:  -3
           0xffffce40:  1
           0xffffce44:  6
           0xffffce48:  -11
           0xffffce4c:  6
           0xffffce50:  -8
           0xffffce54:  -10
           0xffffce58:  0

these are the differences between the letters that must check out in order to succeed

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm

flag is flag{onetwotheflagyo}
