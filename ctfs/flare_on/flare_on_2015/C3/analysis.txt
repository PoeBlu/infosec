another PE file.
looks like a compiled python file into binary
binwalk it, can see image, this is positive.

it is a python file compiled with a pyinstaller
found research in order to reverse it, run some of the scripts now in /opt/decomp

found (between all the junk) a file called elfie (also viewable with pyinstallers viewsource), dumped to disk. decompiled to python file, found massive obfuscated file. 

scroll to the end, dump string rather than exec.
find second very obfuscated file. howeer, can restore strings and some of the functions make sense.

spot boolean option. decode b64 strings to find images.
keep reading, miss email for a while, then spot and win


mention the awesome research I came across while reading up for this
