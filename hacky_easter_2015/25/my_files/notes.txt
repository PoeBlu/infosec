Exported functions of interest : Fizzle, Shizzle
    Shizzle : I think that this reverses the string 

String must be 16 characters long 

fizzle is a transposition function
    results are serially processed, offset in PT is offset in CT
    start of CT is index 8 of PT, then continues linearly

In java : 
    bizzle : shifts alphabetical characters by +1, Z->A , z->a
    rizzle : switches character case around
