unzip apk
make dex->jar
open jar and goto : package ps.hacking.hackyeaster.android;
    look at classes a, i, Activity

    class c : looks like it has a variety of protocols, names include pin, sensors etc

    method h.a probably escapes characters and all  

    package package ps.hacking.zxing; is probably the zebra crossing library, for QR
